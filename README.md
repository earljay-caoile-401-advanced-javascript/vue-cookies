# JS Framework Comparative Analysis

## Framework Name: Vue

### Research Conducted By: Henok Gebremedhn, Thomas T, Joel Watson, and Earl Jay Caoile

### Overall Score and Comments

#### Score (Out of 10): 7

#### General Comments

Vue is a JS framework used on the front end. It is built to be lightweight so that users adopt the parts of it that they want. Vue at its core library focuses on the view layer, but it is also capable of running single page applications.

#### Pros

- Size (lightweight)
- Documentation (easy to read)
- reusable components
- support for TypeScript

#### Cons

- similar but not the same as React (cricket vs. baseball)
- cannot weave JavaScript logic into "HTML" like you can with React
- small community

### Ratings and Reviews

Vue has apparently started taking off in popularity recently. See [this website](https://www.codeinwp.com/blog/angular-vs-vue-vs-react/) for comparisons.

#### Documentation

We thought that Vue was ok, but it's not as nice as React. This is also from the perspective of having learned React thoroughly first and only briefly dabbling in Vue

#### Systems Requirements

Here are a few core libraries:

- [Vue Router for single page apps](https://router.vuejs.org/)
- [Vuex - state management pattern library](https://vuex.vuejs.org/)
- [Vue Server Renderer](https://ssr.vuejs.org/)

#### Ramp-Up Projections

It would take about two weeks to be productive. We also have high standards of what "productive" is.

#### Community Support and Adoption levels

As stated in the above article, Vue's popularity has been increasing lately, but there is still a small community. Also, it doesn't have the backing of a large commmunity like React has with Facebook.
